# Dev Notes
### No templating language
I've included my knowledge in using/setting up a project structure with Handlebars in the MVC exercise, so I think it's duplicate effort to use that here. I could've used templating here but the assignment explicitly asks for HTML/CSS, so I decided to go with pure HTML.

### Webpack + SASS + PostCSS


### Icons
- would prefer SVG icons (though I'm less familiar with setup) over using fonts
